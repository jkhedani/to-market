### Creating new products

1. Navigate to the admin toolbar and hover over "+ New" then selecting the
   Products option.

2. Fill in on the appropriate fields for your product.

3. If any of the fields in "Product Details" vary within the same product, ask
   your site admin to move them over to product options for you. We've taken the
   convention over configuration approach to create less options for you but if
   you need more flexibility go for it! The way we conceptualize each product
   option is as follows: for each product you would create a SKU for, you would
   create a product option.

4. Update and that's it!
