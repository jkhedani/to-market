### Stripe + EasyPost + PayPal
A simple Wordpress shopping + checkout solution that doesn't require any fuss
with e-commercey-bankey nonsense. Secure and safe right out of the box. Yes,
PayPal gets to tag along because a large part of the world still pays with
PayPal but you can choose to alienate them! Your choice, as always, though.
